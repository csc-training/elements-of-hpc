# Operating systems

Personal computers are **single user** devices for general purposes. While the
perfomance of a modern personal computer can surpass the old supercomputers,
they do not aim for the maximum perfomance. Similarly, the operating system is rather
orientated more towards software compatibility,  usability, entertainment,
office work,  mobility, etc. At this moment more than 77% of personal
computers use Windows, while around  17% are running macOS (Apple
proprietary operating systems). The rest of the devices use ChromeOs or some
version of Linux or Unix.

**Supercomputers**, on the other hand, are focused on performing intensive number crunching,
mainly for scientific purpose for a number of users. For a couple of years all supercomputers
which are making it to Top 500 have been using Linux.  

Linux OS has many advantages over
Windows. Unlike Windows and macOS, Linux is modular and built around a kernel
which contains the basic system and drivers. The users now can add to the
kernel various modules to serve the purpose of the device (focused on user
interface or server management, for example). 

Linux is generic in the sense that the
kernel is written in a such a way it can run on any device, from hand-held
gadgets to large supercomputers. It has very good scalability, that is, Linux can
handle efficiently small and large loads. In the case of supercomputer we
expect the system to handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. 

Linux is free and open source. All the undelying code is known and
developers can modify and improve it. There is a large community which is dedicated
to Linux. When problems arise they are very quickly handled. Finally, the cost is a
big factor. A supercomputer has a large number of computing nodes linked together
and using a proprietary OS would mean a licence fee paid for each indvidual
node, which would make the total cost prohibitive.
