# Operating systems

Personal computers are **single-user** devices for general purposes. While the
perfomance of a modern personal computer can surpass old supercomputers,
it does not aim for maximum perfomance. Similarly, its operating system is rather
more oriented towards software compatibility, usability, entertainment,
office work, mobility, etc. At this moment, more than 77% of personal
computers use Windows, while around 17% are running macOS (Apple
proprietary operating systems). The rest of devices use ChromeOs or some
version of Linux or Unix.

**Supercomputers** are focused on performing intensive number crunching,
mainly for scientific purposes, for a number of users. For a couple of years, all supercomputers
that have made it on Top500 have been using Linux.  

Linux OS has many advantages over
Windows. Unlike Windows and macOS, Linux is modular and built around a kernel
which contains the basic system and drivers. Users can add various modules to the
kernel to serve the purpose of the device (focused on user
interface or server management). 

The kernel is generic in the sense that it is written in a such a way that it can run on any device, from hand-held
gadgets to large supercomputers. It has very good scalability, Linux can
efficiently handle small and large loads. In the case of a supercomputer, we
expect the system to handle hundreds or thousands of simultaneous users. 

Linux is free and open source. All underlying code is known, and
developers can modify and improve it. There is a large community dedicated
to Linux. When problems arise, they are very quickly handled. Finally, cost is a
big factor. A supercomputer having a large number of computing nodes linked together
and using a proprietary OS would mean a licence fee paid for each indvidual
node, which would make the total cost prohibitive.
