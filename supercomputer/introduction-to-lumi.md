# The LUMI supercomputer

The LUMI supercomputer will start its operations in CSC’s data center in Kajaani, Finland in 2021. In its final configuration, it will be one of the world’s fastest supercomputers.

LUMI is a unique European endeavor, with ten European countries and the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking (EuroHPC JU) investing in one joint system. It is set to boost research, employment, and competitiveness throughout Europe. The system supplier is Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), providing an HPE Cray EX supercomputer with next generation AMD EPYC CPUs and AMD Instinct GPUs. In addition to the remarkable computing power, LUMI is also one of the world’s most advanced platforms for artificial intelligence, and it will be one of the world’s best known scientific instruments throughout its lifetime.

## The LUMI system architecture explained:

* The LUMI system will be supplied by Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE), based on an HPE Cray EX supercomputer. The peak performance of LUMI is an astonishing 552 petaflop/s, meaning 552 × 10^15 floating point operations per second. This figure makes LUMI one of the world’s fastest supercomputers. For comparison, the world’s fastest computer today (Fugaku in Japan) reaches 513 petaflop/s, and the second fastest (Summit in the US) 200 petaflop/s (more information: www.top500.org). If LUMI’s computing power was compared to normal laptops, it would require the performance of 1,5 million laptops combined. If these laptops were piled up, they would form a tower over 23 kilometers high.
* LUMI will also be one of the world's most advanced platforms for artificial intelligence (AI). With LUMI, it will be possible to combine AI, especially deep learning, and traditional large-scale simulations with massive-scale data analytics in solving research problems.
* The number crunching capability of LUMI is accelerated by the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) partition. It is based on future generation AMD Instinct™ GPUs.
* LUMI will be complemented by a CPU (Central Processing Unit) partition, featuring 64-core next-generation AMD EPYC™ CPUs.
* LUMI’s data analytics partition has 32 aggregated terabytes of memory and 64 visualization GPUs. This partition is used e.g. for visualization, heavy data analysis, meshing, and pre/post-processing.
* LUMI’s storage system will consist of three components. First, there will be a 7-petabyte partition of ultra-fast flash storage, combined with a more traditional 80-petabyte capacity storage, both based on the Lustre parallel file system, as well as a data management service, based on Ceph and being 30 petabytes in volume.
* In total, LUMI will have an astounding storage of 117 petabytes and an impressive aggregated I/O bandwidth of 2 terabytes per second.
* LUMI will also have an OpenShift/Kubernetes container cloud platform for running microservices.
* All the different compute and storage partitions are connected through the very fast Cray Slingshot interconnect of 200 Gbit/s. The global bandwidth of the LUMI-GPU partition is 160 TB/s. The whole global internet traffic would fit therein, twice, in fact!
* LUMI takes over 150 m2 of floor space, which is about the size of a tennis court. The weight of the system is nearly 150 000 kilograms (150 metric tons).

The pre-exascale supercomputer LUMI hosted by CSC will be among the top 5 in the world when it is installed. Together with the other EuroHPC pre-exascale and petascale supercomputers that will be deployed in 2021, the LUMI supercomputer will help Europe’s public and private users address many daunting research and innovation problems across different areas from weather and climate change through cybersecurity to drug discovery and personalised medicine. 

LUMI is an investment of over 200 million euros, covering the whole life cycle of the system. It will lift Europe to the forefront of high performance computing (HPC) and research. Exploiting the potential of the data economy is crucial for Europe’s competitiveness.

The technology modern societies use is strongly based on mathematical modelling: analyses, artificial intelligence, simulations, and optimization. Therefore, powerful computing capacity and data management infrastructure are of the utmost importance for the functioning and well-being of citizens.

## World-class environmental sustainability and energy-efficiency

The LUMI supercomputer is well aligned with the Digital and Green Deal policies of the European Commission.
Located in CSC's carbon-neutral Kajaani data center, LUMI helps the European ICT sector in becoming greener and more cost-efficient, which is a necessity for reaching EU’s ambitious climate targets and paving the way for the green transition. CSC’s data center in Kajaani is among the world’s most eco-efficient: it uses 100% renewable energy produced with hydropower. LUMI’s waste heat will be used in Kajaani’s district heating network: 20% of the area’s yearly district heating needs will be covered with LUMI’s waste heat.
