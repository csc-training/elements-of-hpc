Supercomputing and Cloud Computing

- Onko punaisella merkitty kohta kielellisesti oikein (osion loppupuolella)? Overall, cloud computing reduces complexity for the user in some cases, saves money for small businesses as there are no startup costs, and still delivers good performance. At the same time, setting up virtual machines and the like requires knowledge of installing and maintaining operating systems and software.
