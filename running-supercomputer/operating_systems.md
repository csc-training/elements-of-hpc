# Operating systems

Personal computers are **single user** devices for general purposes. While the
perfomance of a modern personal computer can surpass the old supercomputers,
they do not aim for the maximum perfomance. Similarly, the operating system is rather
orientated more towards software compatibility,  usability, entertainment,
office work,  mobility, etc. At this moment more than 77% of personal
computers use Windows, while around  17% are running macOS (Apple
proprietary operating systems). The rest of the devices use ChromeOs or some
version of Linux or Unix.

**Supercomputers** are focused on performing intensive number crunching,
mainly for scientific purpose for a large number of users. For a
couple of years all supercomputers which are making it to TOP500 have
been using Linux.

Linux has many advantages over other operating systems when it
comes to supercomputers. Unlike Windows and macOS,
Linux is modular and build around a kernel which contains the basic
system and drivers. Because Linux is open source, it is possible to
customize the operating system for a special high-performance
purpose. One can strip down all the unnecessary components and build a
lightweight version with only the absolutely essential code. When
running in massively parallel scale (i.e. using tens or hundreds of
thousands of CPU cores), even miniscule overheads in the operating
system can add up and limit the performance.

The license fees of proprietary operating systems are typically based on the
number of CPUs, and in supercomputer there are **lots** of CPUs. As
Linux is generally free, it allows also considerable savings in the
software costs.
