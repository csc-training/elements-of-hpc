# About the course

Welcome to learn about supercomputing!

Supercomputers are immensely powerful computers that help in solving some of the world’s biggest problems. They are capable of advanced modeling and computing that has only been possible for some years, and although they share common components with ordinary laptops, their computing power is something entirely different.

But how powerful is a supercomputer? How are they built and why do we need them? What are their main advantages and possibilities? In this course we’ll examine these questions and many more. By the end of the course, you will have the theoretical knowledge needed to explain the basic principles of a supercomputer. We’ll also take a look at some real-life examples and practical use cases of these amazing devices.
