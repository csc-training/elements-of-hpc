# Terms in need of explenation
Most termes here are used and explained thoroughly during the course. This section is intended to be a reference/dictionary you can use to freshen your memory while reading.

## [CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit#Structure_and_implementation):
CPU or central processing unit can be considered the brain of the computer. It performs logical, arithmetic, controlling and input/output operations determined by the programs given instructions. 

Modern CPUs/processors consist of multiple processing units on a single integrated circuit. These processing units are commonly referred to as cores. General household computers such as laptops, desktops, phones, tablets etc. have around 4-8 cores. Server processors, such as the ones used in super computers have up to 64 cores, at this moment in time. With time these numbers will go up.

## [GPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit):
GPU or graphics processing unit is a type of processing unit specialized in very simple but fast arithmetic. As the name infers, originally graphics cards were intended in rendering computer graphics, such as in video games and visual effects. 

HPC applications and simulations can often be rendered down to a vast collection of simple arithmetic. Due to this, GPUs are often good tools to "accelerate" the massive amount of calculations done in HPC

## Memory:
Memory is exactly what you would expect it to be. A method for the computer to store and transfer information. There are many memory types ranging from size and speed of acceess. Generally the larger the capacity the slower the access. 

### Disk:
Disk refers to long term storage used by a computer. These methods are generally slow on a program level, but speed varies depending on the device. These devices are for example [hard disk drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive)(HDD), [solid state drive](https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSD)(SSD), [tape drive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tape_drive), USB drive which is a type of SSD. Even a pen and paper could be considered long term storage if you have access to a scanner.
