# Moore's Law

* every 2 years the density of the transitors doubles.

## Consequences

* smaller transitors require less voltage and current
* smaller voltage implies higher clock rates
* higher clocker rate resulted in sinlge processor performance doubling every 18 months

## End of the law?
* more cores, still doubling (at the monent!) the density of the transitors
* clock rate reached the physical limitations
* single precision saturated, but total performance still doubling
* reaching the physical limit of miniaturization
