# What is high-performance computing?

High-performance computing (HPC) is typically defined as "using computing power that is vastly 
larger than available in a typical desktop computer". Utilizing high-performance computing requires
both the hardware, i.e. supercomputer, as well as software, i.e. the tools for programming HPC 
applications and using the supercomputer.

High-performance computing enables breakthroughs in multiple disciplines in science and industry, 
ranging from understanding the origins of the universe to finding new solutions in medicine and health 
care, or for example fighting climate change.
