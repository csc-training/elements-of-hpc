# Welcome to learn about supercomputing!

This free online course is open for everyone interested in supercomputing and high-performance computing.

Modern technological, scientific and industrial breakthroughs require more and more sophisticated and advanced tools in solving the greatest challenges of the world and humankind. We need supercomputers.

Supercomputers are immensely powerful machines capable of advanced modeling and computing with seemingly endless increase of performance. But how powerful is a supercomputer in practice? How are they built and why do we need them? What are their main advantages and possibilities? How are supercomputers used?

In this online course we’ll examine these questions and many more. You will learn the fundamentals of supercomputers and high performance computing, the essential vocabulary needed to understand what supercomputing really is all about, and what is needed to understand how supercomputers used. By the end of the course, you will have the theoretical knowledge needed to explain the basic principles of a supercomputer and high performance computing. We’ll also take a look at some real-life examples and practical use cases of these amazing machines.
