# Supercomputer hardware

The big picture of supercomputer is relatively simple: there are nodes
containing CPUs and possibly GPUs, together with memory, and the nodes
are connected together by the interconnect. When zooming in, things
start to get more complicated, and in this chapter we look the
building blocks in more detail.

In this chapter, we look the structure and the components of modern
supercomputer in more detail.

TODO: should we have here again the image of modern supercomputer ("autopsy")?
