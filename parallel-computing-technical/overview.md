# Supercomputer hardware

The big picture of a supercomputer is relatively simple: there are nodes
containing CPUs and possibly GPUs, together with memory, and the nodes
are connected together by the interconnect. When zooming in, things
start to get more complicated (and interesting), and in this chapter we look
in more detail at the building blocks of a modern supercomputer.

TODO: should we have here again the image of modern supercomputer ("autopsy")?
