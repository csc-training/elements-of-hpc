Chapter 3 – lopputentti

1.	When you buy a new phone or a computer, perhaps you ponder whether to buy something now or wait for a little while for a newer model. Supercomputer vendors must know the current situation but sell future promises. For the money invested, the buyer wants to have state-of-the-art hardware which does not exist yet at the time of purchase. Which of the following are tools for a successful deal?
= Performance commitments that the vendor will propose
= Request for information (RFI) then proposal (RFP) to initiate negotiations with potential sellers.
= Teamwork of multiple people from both - buyer's and seller's - sides.
~ A Well-functioning online store for selecting the right supercomputer parts and real time price updates.
~ Specifications of an old supercomputer which will be updated by adding more memory and CPUs.

2.	Using a supercomputer is
= like visiting a post office or a bank. You take a queuing number and wait for your turn. With supercomputers this is done with a batch queuing system. Note that a batch queue is not implemented sequentially, and several variables effect how the queue is unloaded.
= possible over the internet by using a text-based user interface or in some cases a web browser.
~ free of charge only for researchers. Other have to pay for the usage.
= like learning to drive a formula car: great power may come with more difficult usage thus requiring specific skills 

3.	Running a modern supercomputing service is a complicated endeavor requiring teamwork. Connect job titles and tasks of a typical computing center.
Data center engineer = operate and maintain the power and cooling infrastructure and the network connections.
System administrator = monitor hardware (HW) status and load, make necessary HW adjustments and replace faulty components, updated system software to fix problems and maintain system security.
Scientific software support staff = procure, install, and maintain the software packages based on the users' needs. Help customers in using the packages, write user guides and instructions, and provide training.
HPC programming support staff = helps users in porting, parallelizing, and optimizing their codes for the supercomputers.  

4.	Energy consumption is one of the biggest challenges when designing and building more efficient supercomputers, and a large proportion of the energy used by a computer is converted to heat. Which of the following statements about energy consumption and cooling are true?
•	Energy consumption was a main reason for moving into massively parallel computing instead of making single CPUs more efficient. (TRUE)
•	As far as climate issues are concerned, supercomputers are somewhat contradictory machines: they help in understanding and fighting climate change, but they use large amounts of energy. (TRUE)
•	Air cooling is more complex and efficient method than liquid cooling (FALSE)
•	Supercomputers are measured and evaluated also by their energy efficiency (TRUE)

5.	Which advantages Linux has over other operating systems in supercomputer environments? Select all that apply.
•	Modularity (TRUE)
•	Open source, thus it is possible to customize the operating system (TRUE)
•	Performance can be optimized (TRUE)
•	Stable (TRUE)
•	Free (TRUE)

6.	The most popular operating system in supercomputers is Windows
FALSE

7.	True or false: The forthcoming LUMI supercomputer is funded solely by a Finnish government. All the resources of LUMI are allocated to Finnish researcher via a special application process.
FALSE

8.	The Japanese Fugaku supercomputer is within the ten most energy efficient computers in the world. Still its energy consumption equals that of 10 000 average Finnish households.
(TRUE)
